# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GreenBase is an AI-powered living documentation system designed to eliminate the "Documentation Death Spiral" by automating knowledge base maintenance and providing instant conversational access. The system focuses on four core workflows: automated onboarding from existing sources, intelligent approval queues for verification, low-friction maintenance through voice/text updates, and instant Q&A access via chat bots.

## Glossary

- **GreenBase_System**: The complete AI-powered living documentation platform
- **Manager_Web_UI**: Web-based interface for managers to configure sources and approve content
- **Teams_Bot**: Microsoft Teams bot interface for employee interactions
- **Smart_Approval_Queue**: AI-triaged queue of draft documents requiring manager review
- **Knowledge_Base**: Repository of approved, structured documentation
- **PII_Redaction_Model**: AI model that identifies and removes personally identifiable information
- **Structuring_Model**: AI model that organizes chaotic source data into coherent documents
- **Confidence_Scoring_Model**: AI model that assigns reliability scores to generated content
- **RAG_System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for answering questions
- **Voice_Update**: Audio message submitted by employees for knowledge updates
- **OAuth_Integration**: Secure authentication mechanism for third-party service access

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to automatically ingest knowledge from existing Teams channels and Google Drive folders, so that I can quickly build a comprehensive knowledge base without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager connects a Microsoft Teams channel through OAuth, THE GreenBase_System SHALL fetch all messages with read-only permissions
2. WHEN a Manager connects a Google Drive folder through OAuth, THE GreenBase_System SHALL fetch all documents with read-only permissions
3. THE GreenBase_System SHALL apply PII_Redaction_Model to all ingested content before processing
4. THE GreenBase_System SHALL use Structuring_Model to identify distinct topics and group related information
5. THE GreenBase_System SHALL populate Smart_Approval_Queue with structured draft documents within 24 hours of source connection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a manager, I want an intelligent approval queue that prioritizes content by confidence level, so that I can efficiently review and approve knowledge base updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GreenBase_System SHALL assign confidence scores (Green/Yellow/Red) to all draft documents using Confidence_Scoring_Model
2. THE Manager_Web_UI SHALL display Smart_Approval_Queue with sortable items by confidence level, date, and status
3. WHEN a Manager selects batch approve for Green items, THE GreenBase_System SHALL move all selected items to approved Knowledge_Base
4. THE Manager_Web_UI SHALL provide diff view showing original source, AI-generated draft, and confidence score for individual items
5. WHEN a Manager approves or edits content, THE GreenBase_System SHALL create version history entry with timestamp and approver information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to submit knowledge updates through voice messages or text in Teams, so that I can quickly report changes without leaving my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Employee uses `/greenbase update` command in Teams_Bot, THE GreenBase_System SHALL accept voice recordings or text messages
2. THE GreenBase_System SHALL transcribe voice messages using Azure Speech-to-Text service
3. THE GreenBase_System SHALL use Intent_Recognition_Model to identify target documents and proposed changes
4. THE GreenBase_System SHALL generate proposed document updates and add them to Smart_Approval_Queue
5. THE Teams_Bot SHALL send confirmation message to Employee within 30 seconds of submission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to ask questions and get instant answers from the knowledge base through Teams, so that I can access information without searching through multiple documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Employee asks a question using `/greenbase ask` command, THE Teams_Bot SHALL forward the query to RAG_System
2. THE RAG_System SHALL search only approved Knowledge_Base documents using vector similarity
3. THE GreenBase_System SHALL generate contextual answers with source document citations
4. THE Teams_Bot SHALL respond with formatted answer and clickable source links within 10 seconds
5. THE GreenBase_System SHALL log all Q&A interactions for analytics and improvement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to manage connected data sources and view knowledge base analytics, so that I can maintain control over information sources and monitor system effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Manager_Web_UI SHALL display all connected OAuth_Integration sources with connection status
2. WHEN a Manager disconnects a source, THE GreenBase_System SHALL revoke access tokens and mark related documents as archived
3. THE Manager_Web_UI SHALL provide search and browse functionality for approved Knowledge_Base documents
4. THE GreenBase_System SHALL display document version history with approval timestamps and editor information
5. THE Manager_Web_UI SHALL show basic analytics including approval queue metrics and popular search queries
