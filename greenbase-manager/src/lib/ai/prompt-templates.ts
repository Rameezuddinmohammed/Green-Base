SALES_PLAYBOOK: Sales strategies, client outreach plans, prospect lists with sales context, deal pipelines, sales processes
RESOURCE_LIST: Contact lists, directories, vendor lists, resource catalogs, reference materials without sales context
BUSINESS_PLAN: Business strategies, market analysis, financial projections, company plans, strategic documents
RAW_DATA_ANALYSIS: Data dumps, analytics reports, metrics, research findings, survey results
TECHNICAL_SPEC: Technical documentation, API specs, system requirements, architecture documents
POLICY: HR policies, company guidelines, rules, compliance documents, governance
CV: Resumes, CVs, personal profiles, biographical information
DEFAULT_SOP: Standard operating procedures, step-by-step processes, how-to guides, operational instructions
AI_DETERMINED: Use this for unique document types that don't fit the above categories (e.g., creative content, specialized formats, unusual document structures, mixed-purpose documents)

CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY:
1. First, try to match one of the 8 specific domains (80% of documents should fit)
2. Only use AI_DETERMINED for truly unique or hybrid documents that don't fit standard patterns
3. When in doubt between two specific domains, choose the more specific one
4. AI_DETERMINED should be used sparingly - only for genuinely unusual content

CRITICAL RULES:
- Analyze the CONTENT and PURPOSE, not just keywords
- A contact list for sales purposes = SALES_PLAYBOOK

2. Determine the most appropriate formatting style for that document type

4. Use professional formatting standards appropriate to the document type

FORMATTING OPTIONS (choose the most appropriate):
- Strategic documents: Problem/Solution/Key Points structure
- Reference materials: Tables, lists, categorized sections
- Creative content: Narrative or thematic organization
- Technical content: Specifications, requirements, implementation details
- Personal documents: Profile/experience/skills structure
- Process documents: Step-by-step numbered procedures
- Mixed content: Hybrid approach with clear sections

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Use clear, descriptive headings (## for main sections)
- Choose appropriate list formats (numbered for sequences, bullets for items)
- Maintain professional tone
- Organize information logically
- Remove conversational filler
- Ensure content serves its intended purpose

CRITICAL: If the structured content appears polished but was derived from poor, fragmented, or incomplete source material, assign lower scores for informationCompleteness and factualConsistency, even if the final structure looks good. The AI may have inferred or added information that wasn't in the original source.

Assess these factors (0.0 to 1.0) - BE THOROUGH BUT FAIR:

**contentClarity** (0.7+ for well-structured docs, 0.8+ for exceptional):
- Clear organization and logical structure?
- Appropriate formatting for document type (lists, tables, sections)?
- Unambiguous, professional language?
- Proper headings and information hierarchy?
- Easy to read and understand?

**informationCompleteness** (0.7+ for complete docs, 0.8+ for comprehensive):
- All necessary details present in ORIGINAL source?
- No missing information that had to be inferred?
- Sufficient context and examples from source material?
- Complete information for the document's intended purpose?
- PENALTY: If AI had to significantly expand or infer content, lower this score

**factualConsistency** (0.7+ for reliable content, 0.8+ for exceptional):
- Consistent information throughout original source?
- No contradictions or ambiguities in source material?
- Verifiable and specific information from original?
- Professional and authoritative tone in source?
- PENALTY: If final content is much more polished than fragmented source, lower this score

RED FLAGS (should lower scores significantly):
- Vague language ("maybe", "probably", "I think")
- Missing critical information for document purpose
- Conversational/casual tone without substance
- Questions instead of clear statements
- Very short content (< 200 chars)
- Poor structure or formatting
- Excessive repetition or redundancy
- Unclear or ambiguous information

Context:
- Source quality: ${input.sourceQuality}
- Content length: ${input.contentLength} characters
- Number of sources: ${input.sourceCount}

IMPORTANT: Consider whether the structured content represents genuine quality from the original source, or if it's artificially polished by AI processing of poor source material. Evaluate based on the document's intended purpose (sales playbook, contact list, business plan, etc.).

CRITICAL FOR REASONING: Your reasoning MUST be specific to this actual content. Mention specific sections, topics, procedures, or issues you observe.
